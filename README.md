# An Adaptive Robot Motivational System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a motivational system for an adaptive robot. By implementing reinforcement learning techniques, the system can dynamically adjust its actions based on the satisfaction level feedback from each interaction. This README outlines the project structure and provides a visual representation of the system's performance over multiple episodes.

## Graphical Representation
The graph below displays the satisfaction levels for two different actions taken by the agent over 250 episodes. As seen, 'Action 0 Satisfaction' and 'Action 1 Satisfaction' fluctuate throughout the learning process, indicating the adaptive nature of the robot's decision-making system.

## File Structure
- `An_Adaptive_Robot_Motivational_System.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the motivational system.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
